# emotion-based-art
This project uses a webcam to detect facial emotions in real-time and smoothly transitions between corresponding images for detected emotions. It utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model (`emotion_model.hdf5`) for emotion detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization.
